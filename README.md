Welcome to the Custom Detections project — a personal initiative focused on deep-diving into various malware families to extract meaningful indicators of compromise (IOCs), craft actionable Splunk detection rules, and build precise YARA signatures for threat hunting and malware classification.

The goal is to develop a scalable detection framework that enhances visibility, reduces dwell time, and equips defenders with the tools needed to respond effectively across diverse environments. Whether it’s through behavioral detections, static analysis, or memory-based anomalies, each detection is tailored to identify real-world threats that often bypass traditional security controls.

This repository serves as a growing collection of curated research, detections, and findings from ongoing investigations.
